# Signet Orders

This repository provides example code for **placing and filling Orders** on Signet, built using utilities from [signet-sdk](https://github.com/init4tech/signet-sdk).

---

## Fillers
**Code:** `src/filler.rs`

The `Filler` struct demonstrates the basic steps required to **fill Signet Orders**. Given a set of Orders, it:

1. Constructs and signs **Permit2** structs to fill the Orders on their destination chains.
2. Builds a **Signet Bundle** that batches `initiate` and `fill` transactions for those Orders.
3. Sends the Signet Bundle to the **Transaction Cache**, where it can be mined by Signet Builders.

### Missing Components
In production, a Filler will need to:

- Implement custom **business logic** to determine which Orders to fill.  
- Potentially extend the example logic with **advanced strategies**, such as performing swaps to source liquidity between fills.

### Filling Strategies
The `Filler` struct demonstrates two strategies for filling Orders:

1. **Fill together (`fill`)**  
   - Submits all Orders/Fills in a single Signet Bundle.  
   - Either **all Orders mine** together or **none do** (atomic execution).

2. **Fill individually (`fill_individually`)**  
   - Submits each Order/Fill in its own Bundle.  
   - Orders succeed or fail **independently**.

**Pros and Cons:**

- **Individual fills** are simpler â€” Fillers can rely on Builder simulation instead of pre-checking if an Order is already filled. If an `initiate` transaction reverts (because the Order was already filled), the Bundle is simply discarded.
- **Aggregate fills** are **more gas-efficient** and allow strategies like reusing inputs from one Order to fill another. However, if any single Order fails, the **entire Bundle will not mine**.

## Orders
**Code:** `src/order.rs`

The `SendOrder` struct provides example code for **initiating an Order**. Given an Order specifying input and output tokens, it:

1. Constructs and signs a **Permit2** struct to initiate the Order on-chain.  
2. Sends the signed Order to the **Transaction Cache**, where Fillers can fill it.

---

## Full Example
**Code:** `bin/roundtrip.rs`

This example executable:

1. Constructs an example Order, signs it, and sends it to the Transaction Cache.  
2. Queries available Orders and fills the example Order.

You can freely modify the example Order to:

- Swap **any set of tokens** on the Host and/or Rollup.  
- Use **multiple Inputs and Outputs**, targeting either the Host or Rollup.

---

### Running the Example

1. **Set environment variables**  
```bash
export CHAIN_NAME=pecorino
export RU_RPC_URL=https://rpc.pecorino.signet.sh/
export SIGNER_KEY=[AWS KMS key ID or local private key]
export SIGNER_CHAIN_ID=14174
```

2. **Fund your key**  
The example works with **either** an AWS KMS key or a raw local private key.  
This key acts as **both** the Order Initiator and Filler, and must be funded with:

- Input tokens on the Rollup  
- Output tokens on the Host and/or Rollup  
- Gas tokens to pay for Rollup transactions

By default, the example swaps **1 Rollup WETH Input â†’ 1 Host WETH Output**, but you can edit the Order freely.

3. **Configure token permissions**  
This example uses **Permit2** for both initiating and filling Orders.  
Approve Permit2 to spend all relevant Input and Output tokens for the key:

```bash
cast send [TOKEN_ADDRESS] "approve(address,uint256)" \
  0x000000000022D473030F116dDEE9F6B43aC78BA3 \
  0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff \
  --rpc-url $RPC_URL
```

Permit2 uses the same address on Pecorino Rollup and Host as on Ethereum Mainnet.

4. **Run the script**  
```bash
cargo run --bin order-roundtrip-example
```

### Troubleshooting
Signet Bundles are tied to a **specific block**.  
If your Bundle is not included in that block, it will **not** mine in later blocks.  
Simply re-run the script to retry.
